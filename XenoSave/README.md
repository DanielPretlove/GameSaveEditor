# XenoSave
A library to handle parsing and manipulation of save file data for: 

- Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition
- Xenoblade Chronicles: Future Connected
- Xenoblade Chronicles 2
- Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna The Golden Country

## WARNING: THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS!
This library is still in development, and so far only a few parts of the files have been figured out. Much more reverse engineering of the file format is still required.
